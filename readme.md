This project showcases the use of SQL to build and modify tables, and use joins to query data. I used Power BI to connect to the database and used queries to pull the necessary data. I created a dynamic dashboard which highlights the top drivers by points and podium finishes, along with fastest lap data per Grand Prix. There are slicers for Grand Prix, Constructor, and Year that dynamically filter the data on the visualizations.
